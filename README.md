# Git Helper Script Guide

To get started, first cd into the folder *git*, and then \
run the helper git setup script with your name and the email associated with your github account

***Note: make sure you type your name as one word!*** \
Like this:
```./githelp.sh <your name> <your github email>```

So when running, it would look like: \
```./githelp.sh jenny jennyjones@gmail.com```
